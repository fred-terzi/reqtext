# ReqText by Terzi Tech

**ReqText** is a Git-native, CLI-first requirements and documentation framework that brings requirement management directly into your development workflow. Requirements are edited as hierarchical trees but stored in a flat, ordered structure—making them easy to version, diff, and understand by both humans and AI.

## 🧠 Docucoding with ReqText

**Docucoding** is a new approach to writing and managing code requirements. With ReqText, your requirements live *in your workspace*, alongside your code, using the same tools.

AI-enhanced docucoding transforms how we work with AI. Instead of writing long prompts and iterating manually, ReqText provides a structured framework your chosen AI can understand and update. In the era of AI agents, ReqText gives them the project context they need to go from helpful assistant to actual team member.

## 📄 Introducing `README_AI.reqt`

The `README_AI.reqt` file is a core part of ReqText. It ensures your choice of AI instantly becomes an expert on ReqText and the Docucoding method.

When you initialize a ReqText project, this file is automatically generated to summarize your project’s structure, design intent, and current state in a format optimized for AI tools.

But it doesn't stop there: as you build applications using ReqText, each of those projects can generate their own `README_AI.reqt` files. This allows AI tools to instantly learn how your software is structured and how to interact with it—by embedding internal and external instructions in a consistent, machine-readable format.

ReqText turns your codebase into a living, teachable system—ready for instant onboarding by AI agents or collaborators.

## Quick Start for npm and AI Coders

If you already have Node.js installed and use an AI Agent with terminal access try this: 

### 1. Install ReqText
<pre> ```bash npx reqt init my-app ``` </pre>

### 2. Add `README_AI.reqt` as AI Context and Prompt the AI
<pre> bash
Read this and follow ReqText Docucoding instructions.
```</pre>

### 3. Start Docucoding
<pre> ```bash Create a new ReqText project and teach me how to use it. ```</pre>

>  **A Note from Joe:** I've had great success with this approach using VS Code and Github Copilot. I have not yet been able to try with other AI integrated IDEs, I can't wait to see what you all come up with!

## Installation

> Ensure Node.js is installed before proceeding. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Local Installation

```bash
npm install @terzitech/reqtext
```

### Usage

```bash
npx reqt [command] [options]
```

#### Common Commands

```bash
npx reqt init <project name>     # Initialize a new reqt project
npx reqt editor                  # Launch the interactive tree editor
npx reqt -a "New Item"            # Add a new item to the end
```

> ✅ Both `reqtext` and `reqt` are valid commands. For convenience, `reqt` is the preferred shorthand throughout this guide.

## Terminal Editor

The terminal editor provides an interactive tree view to create, navigate, and structure your `.reqt` items. It's the primary interface for building your requirement hierarchy quickly and visually.
