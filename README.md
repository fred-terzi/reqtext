# ReqText by Terzi Tech

**ReqText** is a Git-native, CLI-first requirements and documentation framework that brings requirement management directly into your development workflow. Requirements are edited as hierarchical trees but stored in a flat, ordered structureâ€”making them easy to version, diff, and understand by both humans and AI.

## ðŸ§  Docucoding with ReqText

**Docucoding** is a new approach to writing and managing code requirements. With ReqText, your requirements live *in your workspace*, alongside your code, using the same tools.

AI-enhanced docucoding transforms how we work with AI. Instead of writing long prompts and iterating manually, ReqText provides a structured framework your chosen AI can understand and update. In the era of AI agents, ReqText gives them the project context they need to go from helpful assistant to actual team member.

## ðŸ“„ Introducing `README_AI.reqt`

The `README_AI.reqt` file is a core part of ReqText. It ensures your choice of AI instantly becomes an expert on ReqText and the Docucoding method.

When you initialize a ReqText project, this file is automatically generated to summarize your projectâ€™s structure, design intent, and current state in a format optimized for AI tools.

But it doesn't stop there: as you build applications using ReqText, each of those projects can generate their own `README_AI.reqt` files. This allows AI tools to instantly learn how your software is structured and how to interact with itâ€”by embedding internal and external instructions in a consistent, machine-readable format.

ReqText turns your codebase into a living, teachable systemâ€”ready for instant onboarding by AI agents or collaborators.

## ðŸ‘‹ A Note from the Developer

This project is in early demo release because I believe the core functionality and methodology are ready for real-world feedback.

Iâ€™m actively working on new features and refinements. Your feedback is invaluableâ€”please [open an issue](https://github.com/terzitech/reqtext/issues) with any bugs, requests, or ideas. Issues always take top priority.

Thank you for checking out ReqText. Happy Docucoding!
