# ReqText Editor Refactor Log: flathier Library Changes

**Date:** 2025-05-16

## Summary
This log documents the changes made to the ReqText CLI/editor, with a focus on the integration and usage of the custom `flathier` library for tree rendering and manipulation.

## flathier Library Integration and Changes

### 1. Integration of flathier for Tree Rendering
- The editor now uses `@terzitech/flathier` (imported as `fhr`) for all tree rendering and manipulation tasks.
- The function `fhr.createAsciiTree` is used in `renderTree` to generate the ASCII representation of the requirements tree, supporting diff-based rendering for minimal flicker.
- The tree rendering logic is now decoupled from the editor, relying on flathier for consistent output and easier maintenance.

### 2. Use of flathier for Item Movement
- The `k` and `j` key handlers (move up/down) now use `fhr.moveUp` and `fhr.moveDown` to manipulate the order of items in the requirements tree.
- After moving an item, the updated data is saved and reloaded using the new data handler service, ensuring data integrity.

### 3. Customization and Extension
- The editor leverages flathier's ability to render custom fields (e.g., `title`, `status`) for each node, supporting project-specific item templates.
- The integration allows for future extension of flathier's capabilities without requiring major changes to the editor logic.

### 4. Error Handling and Robustness
- All flathier operations are wrapped in robust error handling, ensuring that any rendering or manipulation errors do not leave the terminal in a broken state.
- The editor always restores the terminal state, even if a flathier operation fails.

### 5. Testing and Validation
- Integration and unit tests have been updated to cover all flathier-based flows, including tree rendering, item movement, and error scenarios.
- The tests ensure that flathier's output is correctly reflected in the editor and that all edge cases are handled gracefully.

## Summary of Benefits
- **Consistency:** All tree operations and rendering are now handled by flathier, ensuring consistent behavior across the CLI/editor.
- **Maintainability:** Decoupling tree logic from the editor makes future updates and bug fixes easier.
- **Robustness:** Improved error handling and terminal state restoration, even when flathier operations fail.
- **Extensibility:** The editor can now easily support new features and customizations provided by flathier.
